What I learn from the workshop:
This workshop contained mix concepts of Java and it was similar to the past workshops.
In task1,  I learned how to use "cloneable and use comparable<Time>". I also learn how can we convert any time given in hours and minutes into seconds or given in seconds into hours and minutes.
task2 was quite challanging to me as we were asked to find unsafe banks using given details.
Overall, this workshop was fun and full of learning.

The instructions on how to run code:

1)	Open Eclipse IDE and select create a new Java project
2)	Create a project named "workshop10". 
3)	In the src (source) file add the package called "work".
4)	Right-click the "work" package and new classes.
5)	Start implementing the code. Once you are done, click on the "Run" button on the top and select "Run" to run the code or you can simply press "Ctrl + F11" to run the code.
6)	After running the code, you will get output in the console.
