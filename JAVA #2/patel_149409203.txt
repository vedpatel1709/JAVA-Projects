What I learn from the workshop:
In this workshop2, I learned concepts of methods, arrays, and classes. I learned how can we create multiple classes to make code more understandable. 
In addition, I did learn about creating instances of classes, by doing these we can have access to classesâ€™ data members.

I found the getters and setters part most interesting and easy. In that part, we just need to return or assign data members according to the type and arguments.

In IncomeTax class, the method of getIncomeTax() was the hardest and most confusing part for me, especially algorithms.
Furthermore, using so many loops was also quite tricky for me. I used loops to print out arrays and to take valid input from users. 

Mainly, I did learn how to divide code into small methods and call each method when needed. I created choice_1, choice_2, and DisplayTable() methods.

Overall, this workshop was fun and full of learning especially creating instances of classes. 



The Instructions on how to run code:

1)	Open Eclipse IDE and select create a new Java project
2)	Create a project named "workshop2" and in the src (source) file add the package called "ws".
3)	Right-click the "ws" package and add two new class and name it "IncomeTax" and "TestClass".
4)	Start implementing the code. Once you are done, click on the "Run" button on the top and select "Run" to run the code or you can simply press "Ctrl + F11" to run the code.
5)	After running the code, you will get output in console.
