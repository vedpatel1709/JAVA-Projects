What I learn from the workshop:

I learned new concepts regarding inheritance, polymorphism, and exceptional handling in this workshop. For Triangle and TriangleT2, I inherited the abstract class “GeometricObject”.
In addition, I learned how to use the overloading and overriding of given methods.
A TriangleException class was added to task2 to test whether or not the triangle violates the rule. A TriangleException error will be thrown if the triangle violates the rule.
A try-catch statement is implemented in the main function. I learned how the “Try” statement allows us to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed and 
how the “catch” statement allows us to define a block of code to be executed if any error happens in the “Try” block.
Overall, this workshop was fun and full of learning.

The instructions on how to run code:

1)	Open Eclipse IDE and select create a new Java project
2)	Create a project named "ws3" and in the src (source) file add the package called "Task".
3)	Right-click the "Task" package and new classes.
4)	Start implementing the code. Once you are done, click on the "Run" button on the top and select "Run" to run the code or you can simply press "Ctrl + F11" to run the code.
5)	After running the code, you will get output in the console.
