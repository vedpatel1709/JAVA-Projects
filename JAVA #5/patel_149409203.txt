What I learn from the workshop:

In this workshop, I learned different things such as accessing RandomAccessFile, JavaFx, FileOutputStream and Buffered Readers.
But mainly this workshop did target on JavaFx concepts. At my first attempt it was realy hard to create project with JavaFx and adding new paths to project.
I did learn how to create button, textfield, Flowpane and Hbox. Furthermore, I was really hard to assign size/width to given textwidths or 
Overall, it was good learning for me and it was fun to use JavaFx.

The instructions on how to run code:

1)	Open Eclipse IDE and select create a new Java project
2)  	Create new project named "workshop5" and select JavaFX option.
3)	Include .Jar files given by professor in .zip file to run javaFx module.
4)	In the src (source) file add the package called application and add paths of lib and bin directory according to the instructions.
5)	Right-click the application package and new classes.
6)	Start implementing the code. Once you are done, click on the "Run" button on the top and select "Run" to run the code or you can simply press "Ctrl + F11" to run the code.
7)	After running the code, you will get your expected output.
