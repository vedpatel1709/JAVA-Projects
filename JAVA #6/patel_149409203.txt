What I learn from the workshop:
This workshop mainly focused on concepts of JavaFx(GUI), Lambda expressions, functional Interface and arrays.
Task1 of workshop focused on JavaFx(GUI) while Task2 had focused more on Lambda expressions.
While working with Task1 I learned how to create textfield to get text input from user. In addition, I also learned how to use GridPane to create grid and also learned to adjust size of grid.
I had added many text fields, labes, and buttons in it.
In task2, I learned lambda expressions. I had created 5 methods to find max, min, avg, sum and count from given arrayList. Given task2 was the very easy to implement.
Overall, the given workshop was fun and full of learning.

The instructions on how to run code:
1)	Open Eclipse IDE and select create a new Java project
2)  	Create new project named "ws6" and select JavaFX option.
3)	Include .Jar files given by professor in .zip file to run javaFx module.
4)	In the src (source) file add two packages named "Task1" and "Task2".
5)	Right-click the packages and add new classes.
6)	Start implementing the code. Once you are done, click on the "Run" button on the top and select "Run" to run the code or you can simply press "Ctrl + F11" to run the code.
7)	After running the code, you will get your expected output.
